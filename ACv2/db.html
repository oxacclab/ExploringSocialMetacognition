                <h1>About the study</h1>
                <p>In this study you will see a series of events that occurred between <strong>1890</strong> and <strong>2010</strong>. Your task is to identify the year in which that event occurred. You will do this by dragging a marker onto a timeline.</p>
                <p>It is <strong>very important</strong> that you <strong>do not look up the answers</strong>. You will get to see the answers at the end of the study.</p>
            </esm-instruction-page>
            <esm-instruction-page>
                <h1>Advice</h1>
                <p>To help you complete the task, you will receive advice from advisors. You will see the advisors who are giving you advice on the left of your screen. One or more of those advisors may give you advice on each question.</p>
                <p>The advisors will mark their advice on the timeline by adding their own marker. The advisors aren't always correct, but they are quite good at the task. Part of your job is to identify which advisors are best and to weigh their advice accordingly.</p>
            </esm-instruction-page>
            <esm-instruction-page>
                <h1>Summary</h1>
                <p>For most questions you will give an initial answer, see advice, and then give a final answer. For some questions you will just give an initial answer.</p>
                <p>It is <strong>very important</strong> that you <strong>do not look up the answers</strong>. You will get to see the answers at the end of the study.</p>

                <p>You will now have an opportunity to practice the task and get a sense of the kind of questions we ask and how well you can estimate the answers.</p>
                <p>You will get feedback on your performance while you are doing the practice.</p>
                <p>Throughout the practice you can use the ? in the top-right to see the help for any part of the screen again.</p>
                <p>It is <strong>very important</strong> that you <strong>do not look up the answers</strong>. The feedback will tell you what the answer was for each question.</p>

                <h1>Practice with Advice</h1>
                <p>During the main study you will get advice about the correct answer. You will now answer a few questions where you'll receive practice advice so you can get used to it.</p>
                <p>Once you give your <strong>initial answer</strong> you will see an advisor's estimate. You will then be able to provide your <strong>final answer</strong>.</p>
            </esm-instruction-page>
            <esm-instruction-page>
                <p>The advisor will give advice by highlighting a region of the timeline, similar to how you cover parts of it with your markers.</p>

                <h1>Main experiment</h1>
                <p>You will have various advisors who might give you advice. These advisors might behave in different ways, and it's up to you to decide how useful you think each advisor is, and to use their advice accordingly.</p>
                <p>If you're happy with how it works, let's go!</p>

                <h1>Groups</h1>
                <p>The last thing to tell you is that the advisors have been assigned to groups. You can tell which group an advisor is in by the background on the left of the screen, and by the colour of their marker on the timeline.</p>
                <p>One of these groups (GROUP ONE) <strong>matches the colour of your marker</strong>. These advisors will give you the <strong>best advice that they can</strong>.</p>
                <p>The other group (GROUP TWO) has a <strong>different colour to your marker</strong>. The advisors from this group might sometimes try to direct you <strong>away from the correct answer</strong>.</p>
                <p>If you're happy with how it works, let's go!</p>
