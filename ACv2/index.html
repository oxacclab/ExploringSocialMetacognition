                <h1>Welcome</h1>
                <p>We first need to switch to fullscreen mode to begin the study.</p>

                <h1>About the study</h1>
                <p>In this study you will see a series of events that occurred between <strong>1890</strong> and <strong>2010</strong>. Your task is to identify the year in which that event occurred. You will do this by dragging a marker onto a timeline.</p>
                <p>It is <strong>very important</strong> that you <strong>do not look up the answers</strong>. You will get to see the answers at the end of the study.</p>
            </esm-instruction-page>
            <esm-instruction-page>
                <h1>Scoring</h1>
                <p>You will have several markers to choose from. The markers are worth different numbers of points. When your score is calculated, you will get the number of points the marker is worth for all the questions where a marker touches the correct year.</p>
                <p>The thinner the marker is, the fewer years it covers, but the more points you get if you get the answer right. This means you will do better if you use different markers depending upon how confident you are that you know the answer.</p>
            </esm-instruction-page>
            <esm-instruction-page>
                <h1>Advice</h1>
                <p>To help you complete the task, you will receive advice from advisors. You will see the advisors who are giving you advice on the left of your screen. One or more of those advisors may give you advice on each question.</p>
                <p>The advisors will mark their advice on the timeline by adding their own marker. The advisors aren't always correct, but they are quite good at the task. Part of your job is to identify which advisors are best and to weigh their advice accordingly.</p>
            </esm-instruction-page>
            <esm-instruction-page>
                <h1>Summary</h1>
                <p>For most questions you will give an initial answer, see advice, and then give a final answer. For some questions you will just give an initial answer.</p>
                <p>It is <strong>very important</strong> that you <strong>do not look up the answers</strong>. You will get to see the answers at the end of the study.</p>

                <h1>Practice</h1>
                <p>You will now have an opportunity to practice the task and get a sense of the kind of questions we ask and how well you can estimate the answers.</p>
                <p>You will get feedback on your performance while you are doing the practice.</p>
                <p>Throughout the practice you can use the ? in the top-right to see the help for any part of the screen again.</p>
                <p>It is <strong>very important</strong> that you <strong>do not look up the answers</strong>. The feedback will tell you what the answer was for each question.</p>

                <h1>Practice with Advice</h1>
                <p>During the main study you will get advice on the answers you give. You will now do a few questions where you'll receive practice advice so you can get used to it.</p>
                <p>Once you give your <strong>initial answer</strong> you will see an advisor's estimate. You will then be able to provide your <strong>final answer</strong>.</p>
            </esm-instruction-page>
            <esm-instruction-page>
                <p>The advisor will give advice by highlighting a region of the timeline, similar to how you cover parts of it with your markers.</p>
                <p>Once again, you will get feedback on each question as you go. Remember this will tell you about how well the advisor does, as well as how well you do.</p>
                <p>It is <strong>very important</strong> that you <strong>do not look up the answers</strong>.</p>
