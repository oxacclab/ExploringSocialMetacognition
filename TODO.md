# To do list:

## Benevolence study
### Initial
* ~~Finalize design~~
* ~~Preregistration~~
* ~~Run~~
* ~~Data analysis~~
* ~~Refine paradigm~~
* ~~Preregistration~~
* ~~Run~~
* ~~Data analysis~~
* ~~Redesign for explicit benevolence manipulation~~
* ~~Preregistration (not done)~~
* ~~Run~~ 
* ~~Data analysis~~ 
* Redesign explicit benevolence manipulation
    * ~~Clearer manipulation~~
        * ~~At advisor introduction~~
            * ~~"will sometimes try to mislead"~~
        * ~~"You are in Group 1" displayed throughout~~
    * ~~Actually provide occasionally bad advice from outgroup advisor~~
    * ~~Improve advice slightly (inc. for training advisor)~~
* Preregistration
* Run
* Data analysis 
### Registered Report
* Identify journal(s)
* RR stage 1
* Revise RR
* Run RR
* RR stage 2

## Core studies
* ~~Clarify marker usage (confidence)~~
* Redesign core studies
    * ~~One marker width~~
    * ~~Post-decision confidence judgement~~
* ~~Implement Agree-in-confidence/uncertainty advisors~~
    * ~~Discrete distances from participant marker 3, 5, 7 | 9, 11, 13~~
    * ~~AiC uses first set where high conf~~
    * ~~AiU uses second set where high conf~~
    * ~~Tests on trials where 8 used regardless of confidence (offbrand)~~
    * ~~Integration tests~~
* Run AiC/AiU study
### Advisor choice
* ~~Implement advisor choice~~
* Run advisor choice for Agree/Accurate
    * Choice trials should give offbrand advice, so influence can be compared on choice trials (how to compare for participants who only pick one advisor?)
* Run advisor choice for AiC/AiU

## Non-advice-takers
* Work out how to recruit people who don't take advice
* Develop paradigm for testing people's base levels of advice-seeking/taking
    * Time-taking alternative to getting advice
        * See advice but opt out of using it before/after seeing it?

## Agent-based models
* Build model of agents' advisor-updating and source selection
* Run dynamic networks of interacting agents
* Characterize resulting network structures based on agent properties (e.g. model components)
* Does including non-advice-takers change network structure?
    * Model as normal agents with particularly low update rates?

## Real-life networks
* Characterize real-life social networks in terms used for ABMs above
* Compare RL networks to ABM networks
